# Constellations

This repository contains the code for how I created the constellations.sty package using the constellationship.fab file from stellarium ([was here, now is gone](https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/blob/master/skycultures/modern/constellationship.fab)).

constellations.sty is built on the tikz package and creates constellations that can be put within a LaTeX document.

I built this for some more flavor in my lab reports. Since it not an official package (yet), to use it, drag it into the files section of your LaTeX editor (e.g. Overleaf) and use \usepackage{constellations} as normal.
