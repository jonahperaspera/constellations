# Constellations

This repository contains the code for how I created the constellations.sty package using the constellationship.fab file from [stellarium]([url](https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/blob/master/skycultures/modern/constellationship.fab)).

constellations.sty is built on the tikz package and creates constellations that can be put within a LaTeX document.

I built this for some more flavor in my lab reports.
